%% Sudoku Solver
% This is a MATLAB(R) program designed to solve sudoku puzzles of the 9x9 
% kind using a brute force algorithm called backtracking. This html
% documentation has been generated using MATLAB(R)'s publishing feature.
% Text highlighted in green within code snippets are comments. The code
% snippets here, combined together, form the complete program.

% This program has been written in MATLAB(R) R2015a, MATLAB(R) R2016a, and
% MATLAB(R) Online (R2017a at the time of writing). As a result, it has been
% tested to run these versions of MATLAB(R). It should run on newer
% versions and might run on versions a few years old, but this is just an
% assumption that hasn't been tested.
% 
% This code requires MATLAB(R) to run. You need to have MATLAB(R) installed
% on your system to run this program. Alternatively, you can use MATLAB(R)
% Online to run this program which is just MATLAB(R) running on the cloud.
% To run this program using MATLAB(R) Online, upload the 'sudoku.m' file 
% to your MATLAB(R) Online's working directory and click on the 'Run'
% button in the EDITOR tab.
% If you have MATLAB installed on your system, open the source file in
% MATLAB(R) and click on the 'Run' button from the EDITOR tab. In both the
% cases, the code will run without any arguments and ask the user for the
% input Sudoku puzzle before proceeding.
% 
% <<NoArguments.PNG>>
% 
% If the user already has 9x9
% matrices of Sudoku puzzles in the workspace, then typing
% 'sudoku(Sample1)' in the command window will run the program where
% 'Sample1' as the input matrix.

% 

%% Main Function
%
% This is the main function that gets executed first when the program is
% run. Typing "sudoku" in the MATLAB(R) command window will run the program
% without any arguments and the program will ask the user to
% enter a 9x9 sudoku matrix as the input argument.
% Alternatively, the user can call the program with the 9x9 grid as an
% argument.
% 

function sudoku(X)

% When run without any arguments, the programs will prompt the user to
% input the Sudoku puzzle.

%% Validity Check
% 
% This function checks the validity of the input 9x9 matrix and determines
% if it's a valid sudoku puzzle.
%
% The funtion, by default, assumes that the
% input is valid and checks against some conditions.
% If even one of the conditions is not met, then the input 
% is declared as invalid and the
% program asks the user to reenter the input matrix.
% 

function [valid,invalid]=valid_sudoku(X)
invalid=false;

% The following part of the code checks if the input is a 9x9 matrix.
% Input anything else and the program will tell you that the input is not
% valid.

if size(X)~=[9,9] 
    invalid='The input is not a 9x9 matrix.\n';
    valid=false;
    return;
end

% This part of the code checks if the 9x9 matrix contains only integers
% from 0 to 9. Anything else would make the input invalid, and ask for a
% reenter.

if ~(fix(X)==X & X<=9 & X>=0)
    invalid='The input should contain only integers 0 to 9.\n'
    valid=false;
    return;
end

% Then the input matrix is tested for violations within the same row or
% column, a violation being repetition of entries within the same row or
% column.

for row=1:9
    if ~isequal(sort(nonzeros(X(row,1:end))),nonzeros(unique(X(row,1:end))))
                invalid=sprintf('The input is an invalid puzzle. Some entries are being repeated in row %d.\n',row);
                valid=false;
                return;
    end
end
for col=1:9
    if ~isequal(sort(nonzeros(X(1:end,col))),nonzeros(unique(X(1:end,col))))
                invalid=sprintf('The input is an invalid puzzle. Some entries are being repeated in column %d\n.',col);
                valid=false;
                return;
    end
end

% Each 3x3 sub-grid is then tested for repetition of elements. If a
% repetition has occurred, then the input is regarded as invalid.

for row=1:3:7
        for col=1:3:7
            temp=X(row:row+2,col:col+2);
            if ~isequal(sort(nonzeros(temp)),nonzeros(unique(temp)))
                valid=false;
                invalid=sprintf('Some elements are being repeated in the subblock starting at the position (%d,%d)\n.',row,col);
                return;
            end
        end
end
valid=true;
end

%% Obtain Sub-Grid for a Position
% 
% This function breaks the 9x9 input grid into 9 grids of of 3x3 each so
% that it becomes easy for the program to check for violation within the
% grid when a particular position is accessed.
% 
% More specifically, this function determines the sub-grid that a position
% belongs to when its row number and column number are supplied.
% 

function block=sub_block(X,row,col)

%  Creates position indexes for the starting positions of sub-grids. Start
%  at 1, increment by 3, stop at 7.

index=1:3:7;

%  Obtain the sub-grid's first row's number and first column's number from
%  the row number and column number of the position supplied.
%  'ceil' function rounds the result of the division to the next integer.

sub_row=index(ceil(row/3));
sub_col=index(ceil(col/3));

% Use the first row and first column to obtain the sub-grid by incrementing
% twice.

block=X(sub_row:sub_row+2,sub_col:sub_col+2);
end

%% Find Possible Candidates
% 
% This function evaluates the possible candidates at a position by
% elimination.
% 

function candidates=missingcandidates(X,row,col)

% The first line declares an array containing the integers 1
% through 9.

full = 1:9; 

% The second line checks what elements are present in the same row and
% converts those elements to 0 in the array. The third line does the same
% for the elements in the same column and the fourth repeats that for
% elements in the same sub-grid.

full(nonzeros(X(row,:))) = 0; 
full(nonzeros(X(:,col))) = 0; 
full(nonzeros(sub_block(X,row,col)))= 0; 

% The final line declares an array which contains all the non zero elements
% of the array declared in the first line after the operation on the array
% is complete. The function returns this array whenever called.

candidates = nonzeros(full)'; 
end

%% Generate Cell Array
% 
% This function first creates a cell matrix from the input matrix. The blank
% places are zeroes and the filled places contain the respective digits.
% The cell array created is filled using the 'missing candidates' function
% to create a cell matrix of possibilities.
%
% A matrix is an array of numbers - each position in a matrix can conatain
% only one element of a specific type, integers in this case. In contrast,
% a cell matrix or a cell array is a general container, which will hold any
% object. A cell here is used so that in every position, an array can be
% stored which contains the list of possible elements in that position.
%

function Xcell=CandidateCell(X)
    Xcell=num2cell(X);                                          % Create a cell array from the matrix
    for col=1:9
        for row=1:9
            if X(row,col)==0
                Xcell{row,col}=missingcandidates(X,row,col);    % Call the missing candidates funtion to fill the array
            end
        end
    end
end
                
%% Fill Singletons
% 
% This function checks the cell array for positions where only one
% possibility exists and then proceeds to fill these singletons. 
% 

function X=FillSingletons(X,Xcell)
    for col=1:9
        for row=1:9
            if size(Xcell{row,col},2)==1    % If only one possibility exists,
                X(row,col)=Xcell{row,col};  % fill it in the matrix
            end
        end
    end
end

%% Repeatedly Fill Singletons
%
% This function repeatedly calls the previous two functions, i.e.
% 'CandidateCell' and 'FillSingletons' as long as the matrix is
% changing. It stops when the matrix after attempting to fill singletons is
% the same as the matrix just before.
%

function [Xnew, XCell]=RepeatCandidates(X)
    XCell=CandidateCell(X);
    Xnew=FillSingletons(X,XCell);
    while abs(sum(sum(Xnew-X)))>0
        X=Xnew;                         % Result becomes the input for the next loop
        XCell=CandidateCell(X);         % Generate Cell Array
        Xnew=FillSingletons(X,XCell);   % Fill Singletons
    end
end
